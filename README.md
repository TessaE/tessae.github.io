# Tessa's dev site

Welcome to the source code of my personal dev website! This site is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a static site generator. The site is hosted here on Github Pages.

From the root of the project, run ```bash npm install``` to install the dependencies. Then, run ```bash npm run start``` to start the local dev server at localhost:8080.
